# Shot Form Analyzer

An AI-powered web application that analyzes basketball shooting form from uploaded videos, providing actionable feedback to improve shooting technique.

## 📋 Overview

The Shot Form Analyzer uses computer vision and machine learning to assess a player's shooting mechanics. Users can upload short video clips of their basketball shots, and the application will analyze key aspects of their form, comparing them to ideal shooting techniques used by elite players.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Video Upload Interface**: Simple drag-and-drop functionality for uploading shot videos
- **Computer Vision Analysis**: Automatic pose estimation to identify key joints and body positions
- **Form Metrics**: Measurement of critical shooting form factors:
  - Elbow angle
  - Release point height
  - Shot arc trajectory
  - Body alignment
  - Follow-through completion
- **Comparative Analysis**: Personalized report comparing user's form to ideal shooting mechanics
- **Improvement Recommendations**: Actionable feedback to enhance shooting consistency and accuracy

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js
- **Computer Vision**: TensorFlow.js with PoseNet/MoveNet models
- **Video Processing**: MediaPipe for body tracking and joint detection
- **Data Visualization**: D3.js for visual representation of form analysis
- **Storage**: Browser-based storage for user progress tracking

### System Architecture

1. **Video Capture & Processing Layer**
   - Video upload and preprocessing
   - Frame extraction for analysis
   
2. **AI Analysis Layer**
   - Pose estimation and tracking
   - Shot motion analysis
   - Metrics calculation
   
3. **Feedback Generation Layer**
   - Comparison with ideal form database
   - Personalized recommendation system
   
4. **Visualization & User Interface Layer**
   - Interactive feedback presentation
   - Progress tracking visualizations

## 🚀 Getting Started

npm start
```

## 📊 Shot Form Metrics Explained

The Shot Form Analyzer evaluates several key aspects of shooting mechanics:

| Metric | Description | Ideal Range |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Elbow Angle | Angle of the shooting arm's elbow at release point | 85-95° |
| Release Point | Height and position of ball release relative to body | Above eye level, slightly right/left of center for right/left-handed shooters |
| Shot Arc | Trajectory angle of the ball | 45-55° |
| Alignment | Body positioning and alignment during shot | Shoulders, hips, and feet aligned to basket |
| Follow-through | Completion of shooting motion after release | Full extension, "dipping" wrist |

## 🔍 Example Analysis

```
Shot Analysis Results:
- Elbow Angle: 82° (Elite range: 85-95°)
  RECOMMENDATION: Slightly increase your elbow angle for better power transfer
  
- Release Point: 7.2 ft (Elite range: 7.5-8.5 ft for your height)
  RECOMMENDATION: Work on releasing the ball slightly higher
  
- Shot Arc: 42° (Elite range: 45-55°)
  RECOMMENDATION: Increase your arc slightly for better shooting percentage
  
- Overall Form Score: 78/100
```

## 📝 Development Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Core video upload and basic form analysis (current)
- **Phase 2**: Enhanced analytics and comparison with NBA shooter database
- **Phase 3**: Shot tracking and progress monitoring over time
- **Phase 4**: Mobile app development with real-time analysis
