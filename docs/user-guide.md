- **Lighting**: Ensure good, even lighting with minimal shadows
- **Clothing**: Wear fitted clothing that contrasts with the background
- **Frame Rate**: 30fps or higher recommended
- **Resolution**: 720p or higher recommended

## Understanding Your Analysis Results

After processing, your analysis will be displayed with several components:

### Overview Score

The overall score (0-100) represents how closely your form matches ideal shooting mechanics. This is a weighted average of all the individual metrics.

### Key Metrics

Each metric is displayed with:
- Your measured value
- The ideal range for that metric
- A color-coded indicator (red = needs improvement, yellow = fair, green = excellent)

#### Elbow Angle

The angle of your shooting arm elbow at the release point. Ideal range is typically 85-95 degrees.

#### Release Point

The height at which you release the ball, relative to your body height. Elite shooters typically release the ball above eye level, with the optimal height varying based on your height and shooting style.

#### Shot Arc

The trajectory angle of the ball. The ideal range of 45-55 degrees provides the best combination of distance efficiency and forgiveness on the rim.

#### Alignment

How well your shoulders, hips, and feet are aligned toward the basket. Proper alignment ensures consistent direction and power transfer.

#### Follow-through

The completion of your shooting motion after the ball is released. A full extension with proper wrist action is key to shooting consistency.

### Visual Feedback

- **Form Overlay**: Your shooting form with skeletal tracking overlay
- **Comparison View**: Side-by-side comparison with an ideal form model
- **Angle Measurements**: Visual indicators of key angles in your shot

## Implementing Feedback

### Personalized Drills

Based on your analysis, the system recommends specific drills to address your areas for improvement:

1. **Form Shooting**: Close-range repetition focusing on proper mechanics
2. **Wall Form**: Practicing against a wall to reinforce proper alignment
3. **Balance Drills**: Exercises to improve stability during your shot
4. **Release Drills**: Focus on optimal release point height and timing

### Integrating into Practice

For best results:
- Focus on one or two aspects of your form at a time
- Practice the recommended drills for 10-15 minutes daily
- Gradually increase shooting distance as your form improves
- Re-analyze your form weekly to track changes

## Frequently Asked Questions

Our computer vision models have been trained on thousands of shots from players at all levels. While no automated system is perfect, our testing shows 85-90% accuracy compared to professional coaching analysis.

### Can I analyze different types of shots?

Yes! The system can analyze jump shots, free throws, catch-and-shoot, and pull-up jumpers. Simply tag your video with the shot type during upload.

### Does the system work for players of all ages?

Yes, the system is designed to work for players of all ages, but is most accurate for players aged 12 and up due to the proportional differences in younger players.
